Goals: Reach the rainbow platform
Rules: move in the air and don't fall to the bottom of the map
Feedback: can view player hp/points
Freedom: run side to side, jump, drop


When Mobs are hit, players loses a point
Add different platforms
When player has 0 points, the player respawns
Player can't move off the screen: when moving left, player respawns right and visa versa
