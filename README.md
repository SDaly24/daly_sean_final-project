# Fall2023_final_project

Simple overview of use/purpose.

This is an extension of the game we already created. 
## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

This project will include new elements within the code base which was my game. I am adding multiple new class, platforms, and features to the game which will increase the complexity significantly. While it may have no use outside of enjoyment of playing the game, it will demonstrate my ability to explain and add new elements to a code myself.
